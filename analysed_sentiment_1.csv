Great place with delicious food and friendly staff. It is small but has outdoor seating and a relaxed ambiance. Perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee. I am visiting Sydney for the first time but this place seems like is a local favorite.,9.8,positive

Ricotta hot cakes! These were so yummy. I ate them pretty fast and didn't share with anyone because they were that good ;). I ordered a green smoothie to balance it all out. Smoothie was a nice way to end my brekkie at this restaurant. Others with me ordered the salmon Benedict and the smoked salmon flatbread. They were all delicious and all plates were empty. Cheers!,5.3,positive

"We came for brunch twice in our week-long visit to Sydney. Everything on the menu not only sounds delicious, but is really tasty. It really gave us a sour taste of how bad breaky is in America with what's so readily available in Sydney!  Both days we went were Saturdays and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, the cafe is extremely busy for both dine-in and take-away. Service is fairly quick and servers are all friendly. The location is in Surrey Hills a couple blocks away from the bustling touristy Darling Harbor.The green smoothie is very tasty and refreshing. We tried the smoked salmon salad, the soft shell crab tacos, ricotta hotcakes, and the breaky sandwich. All were delicious, well seasoned, and a solid amount of food for the price. A definite recommend for anyone's trip into Sydney!",6.6,positive
"I came to Social brew cafe for brunch while exploring the city and on my way to the aquarium. I sat outside. The service was great and the food was good too!I ordered smoked salmon, truffle fries, black coffee and beer.",5.9,positive
It was ok. The coffee wasn't the best but it was fine. The relish on the breakfast roll was yum which did make it sing. So perhaps I just got a bad coffee but the food was good on my visit.,6.6,positive
Great coffee and vibe. That's all  you need. Crab was outstanding but not good finger food like a taco should be. Really want to try the pork belly sandwich - looked excellent. This became my go to breakfast place in Darling harbor. Had the avocado salmon salad breakfast and it was excellent. Service has been excellent.,9.8,positive
